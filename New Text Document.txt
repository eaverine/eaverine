Hi, 
I am an experienced python developer who has used his skills to build solutions around systems automation, machine learning and AI.

I'm suited for this role because I've previously built a desktop app to generate songs based on combination of beats, performed music analysis with python, and also worked with a DJ to automatically update music cover arts with python.

I would love to hear back from you. Thanks
